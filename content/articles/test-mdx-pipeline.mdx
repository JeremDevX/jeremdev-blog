# Test MDX Pipeline

This is a test article to verify the MDX compilation pipeline works correctly.

## Code Block with Syntax Highlighting

Here is a TypeScript code block that should render with Shiki syntax highlighting:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

function greetUser(user: User): string {
  return `Hello, ${user.name}!`;
}

const user: User = {
  id: "1",
  name: "Jerem",
  email: "jerem@example.com",
};

console.log(greetUser(user));
```
